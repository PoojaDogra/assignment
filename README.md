# assignment
#This project has three java files
#AddingLists.java
#DeletinglistTest.java
#UpdatinglistTest.java
#As the name suggests they perform adding to a list, delete and update
#This is just a start.I plan to write functions and segregate the functionality of each function
#Also this code was initially made using selenium ide, then exported to eclipse
#i found selenium version that i had wasnt compatible with latest firefox browser. 
#Then used geckodriver.exe
